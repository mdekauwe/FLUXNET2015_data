I cleaned up the site info to generate a file (site_info.csv) that is actually usable

```
$ python src/get_site_info.py > site_data/site_info.csv
```

## Todo

It would be an idea to scrape some other useful site characteristics about the
sites and add to this list. I had a bash with tower height, I should return to
this
